# Starting a new notebook

**You cannot start a *new* notebook from the command line:**

```shell
jupyter notebook
# then click new, etc
```

------------------------------

# Working with existing notebooks 

1. Use `jupytext` to [convert the notebook](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext#command-line-conversion) to a plain text python file
 
```shell
# Turn notebook.ipynb into a paired ipynb/py notebook
jupytext --set-formats ipynb,py notebook.ipynb
```
 
2. Open `.py` file in VSCodium and edit

3. Sync

```shell
# Update all paired representations of notebook.ipynb  
jupytext --sync notebook.ipynb                  
```

------------------------------

## Misc

within jupyter: type `'%whos'` to see what variables you've assigned,
like `ls()` in R
