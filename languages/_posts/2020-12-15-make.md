## GNU Make

---

### Basics

- `$ make foo`

Force rebuild:

- `$make -B foo`

Automatic variables:

- `$@` - the target
- `$<` - first prerequisite
- `$^` - all prerequisites
- `$(<F)` - file part of first prerequisite
- `$(<D)` - directory part of first prerequisite
- `$(@D)` - directory part of target
- `$(@F)` - file-within-directory part of target
- `%` - wildcard

---

### Advanced

Make dependency only if file doesn't exist (i.e. ignore time-stamps):

See <https://stackoverflow.com/a/21754930/3362993>

```bash
# examples/foo.h will only be built if it doesn't exist
# the time-stamps of items to the right of | are ignored
examples/foo.h : | foo.h
    cp $| $@
```

Touch all prerequisites of a target:

```bash
make foo.pdf --touch
```

---

### Misc

`.PHONY` for indicating not-real targets

See <http://stackoverflow.com/a/7081747/897303>

```
.PHONY: all doc clean
```
